SVG Translator Tabajara
#######################

This is just a weekend project which takes an SVG strip from `hacktoon.com`_ and does a quick translation from Brazilian PortuguÃªs to English.

Note that the comic strips from HackToon aren't automatically translated with Google Translator! This project is just a **proof of concept**.

**About the name:**  For those from others countries (or Brazilians under 20 years old), once there was a TV Show named "Casseta & Planeta", which had a recurring sketch on products from a company called Tabajara, but all their products (which names always ended with the suffix 'ator') had dubious purposes and/or qualities.
